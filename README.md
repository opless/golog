golog
=====

Prolog interpreter in Go with aspirations to be ISO compatible.  See the [full package documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/mndrix/golog) for usage details.

Install with

    go get github.com/mndrix/golog

Status
------

The long term goal is to make Golog fully compliant with ISO Prolog.  It currently supports a subset of ISO Prolog.  Any deviations from the standard are bugs.  Please report [issues](https://github.com/mndrix/golog/issues) to help Golog improve.

Golog is used in production systems, but should be considered experimental software.  It has bugs and sharp edges.

Development is sponsored by [PriceCharting](https://www.pricecharting.com).

I've modified it here and there for my own purposes.

You probably don't want this. :)
